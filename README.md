## 📌 Current Progress  

- ✅ **Core Python** (OOP, Functions, File Handling, APIs, Multithreading)  
- ✅ **NumPy** (Arrays, Broadcasting, Vectorization, Performance Optimization)  
- ✅ **Pandas** (Data Cleaning, Merging, Grouping, Aggregation, Analysis)  
- ✅ **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (Statistical Visualizations, Custom Styling)  
- ✅ **SQL** (Queries, Joins, Aggregations, Real Projects)  
- ✅ **Excel** (Dashboards, Pivot Tables, Reports)  
- ✅ **Statistics** (Central Tendency, Spread, Probability, Outliers, 5-Number Summary)  
- 🔄 **Machine Learning with scikit-learn** (Currently learning Supervised ML algorithms)  
- 🔜 **Deep Learning (PyTorch & TensorFlow)**
